      "The financial industry faces a dilemma. While there is a demand for quick, smooth, and engaging user experiences, financial regulators continually introduce stricter requirements in terms of KYC (Know Your Customer), AML (Anti Money Laundering), and AT (Anti-Terrorism). Breaching these regulations can result in severe penalties, especially for businesses engaged in substantial money transactions (B2Bs). Striking a balance between providing user-friendly services and complying with evolving regulatory standards is a complex challenge in the financial sector.",

This process involves a series of verification steps, including document verification, age verification, address verification, and any other steps deemed necessary by the Monetary Authority (Central Bank) of a country. The primary objective is to enable the financial sector to gain a comprehensive understanding of its customers and assess the associated risk levels.",

          "To address this, we aimed to provide succinct reminders to our merchants regarding their verification status. This was crucial since, as mentioned earlier, completing the verification process was essential for merchants to conduct live transactions. For instance, if a merchant closed their browser or encountered a distraction during the process, it was easy for them to forget that they had initiated the verification. This realization often occurred when a representative from the customer experience team reached out to them.",

The email was designed to be triggered 30 minutes after a browser session ended and the verification process remained incomplete. This strategic timing aimed to serve as a reminder to merchants who may have left the process unfinished, encouraging them to resume and complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) verification.",
